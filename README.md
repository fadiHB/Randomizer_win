# Randomizer_win

an application that helps the instructor who is working online during the lecture to choose a random student for asking and participate and that helps to make the student focus more on the lecture.

## The Features

* Creating a list of students.
* Ability to update the existing list by appending new names to it.
* Ability to update the list (delete or edit name) from the txt file.
* Making a reset and creating a new list.

## The Instructions

1. [python programming language](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is needed.
      
3. Clone the repo.

3. Go to the dist folder, then open the randomizer file (it's an executable file)

4. * Create a list of students.
        there are two ways:
        + adding students one by one by the GUI.
    when you create a list using the GUI, a new txt file will be created named "students_list" that contains your data, and the app will read the data from this file(you can also from this file do any update or delete to the data)
        + putting a txt file named "students_list" that contains all students' names in the same location of the randomizer file,  the students' names should be separated by a new line. 
    
5. after setting the list, click "Finish" to start picking a random name.

6. to make a new list, click reset.
**P.S** when you do a reset, students_list file will be deleted.
